**Run Date:** 2025-12-26 17:50:30
**Data Period:** Last 5 Days (Intraday)

## Hypotheses
1. **Market Open / Retail Action:** Large cap stocks with pre-market news often see "typo" stock correlation spike early in the trading day (09:30 - 10:00 AM) due to retail trader execution errors.
2. **Buying Pressure:** Correlations are expected to be stronger when the target stock is experiencing positive returns (buying pressure), as FOMO drives rapid, error-prone entry.
3. **Mean Reversion:** These correlations are temporary inefficiencies. As traders realize errors, the "typo" stock price should revert, making this a short-term mean-reversion play.
